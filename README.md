Assignment 2 all 3 parts

Part 1 : Performing analysis using jadbio auto ML capabilities. I downloaded a diabetes census file from kaggle and ran the data set on jadbio. 
It first ransformed the data and found the important features to take into considerations. 

Then it asked to move forward with analysis of one particular attribute, which was set to be predicted. It than runs different models, chooses the best model and displays the result in visual formats. I have attatched the required screen cast files which shows the whole process and also the final result visualization.
